#### PHYS 2421.HN1

This class is a more rigorous version of PHYS 2325 with additional topics in analysis of accelerometer measurements and possibly thermal physics. Derivations in this class may handle more general cases and we will rely more heavily on calculus concepts and use of vectors. Expect more challenging problems and applications plus a capstone project. Two lectures plus a required recitation session per week.
Topics: Calculus-based physics study of space and time, kinematics, forces, energy and momentum, conservation laws, rotational motion, torques, harmonic oscillation, fluids, and if time permits, kinetic theory of heat and thermodynamics.
Students will master the derivation and application of the following physical concepts:
• Use of vectors, vector addition, vector subtraction, dot and cross products
• Linear motion: displacement, velocity, acceleration
• The nature of forces
• Newton’s Laws of Linear Motion
• Energy and Potential
• Momentum and Collisions
• Gravitation, Orbits
• Center of mass, motion of rigid bodies
• Angular motion: angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration, angular momentum, torque.
• Static equilibrium
• Harmonic motion
• Wave motion
• Kinetic theory of heat for an ideal gas (time permitting)
