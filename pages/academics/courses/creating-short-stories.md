#### CREATING SHORT STORIES

#### Instructor: DR. CLAY REYNOLDS

#### CRWT 3307

CRWT 3307 will be a course of instruction in basic fiction writing with a focus on the short story. Students will be introduced to the fundamental elements of fiction and will work through a series of exercises then will produce at least two original short stories of their own composition that will be critiqued and discussed by the entire class. This will be a reading/writing intensive course. Full attendance will be required. No previous creative writing experience is necessary; however, students should have a solidÂ knowledge of English grammar and mechanics. They also should be prepared to produce hard copy copies of their work for peer review and critique and to do a good deal of background reading on their own. The goal of the course will be for each student to produce at least one submit-able work of short fiction and to gain an ability to read critically and respond directly to constructive critical analysis.
