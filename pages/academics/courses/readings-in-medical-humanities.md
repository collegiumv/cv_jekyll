 No single person had more of an impact on modern medicine than Sir William Osler – physician, educator, author, first chief of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical School, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University. He was the author of The Principles and Practice of Medicine (1892) the textbook that established him as the world’s foremost authority on teaching medicine. In his writings and speeches he explored many issues that still resonate today, including the relationship of the humanities and science in the practice of medicine. We will examine together his ideas as expressed in his writing, their influence, and in one case a controversy sparked by one of his speeches that was recently reviewed.
