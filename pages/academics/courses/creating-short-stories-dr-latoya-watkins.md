#### Creating Short Stories

#### Instructor: Dr. Latoya Watkins

#### CRWT 3307

This course will proceed in a studio format, combining lecture/discussion with the peer-workshop motif, focusing on individual, original work. The class will focus on the traditional tools used to create short fiction and take a step-by-step approach to understanding character, plot, narration and structure. Emphasis will be on the fundamentals of storytelling, including point of view and establishing a narrative voice. The primary focus of the course will be on student writing. Students will read selected stories that will serve as examples or models from contemporary and modern literature. Students will be encouraged to be experimental and iconoclastic in their own writing.  Although the prerequisite for this course is waved for honors students, all participants are expected to be competent in reading and writing in the English language.
