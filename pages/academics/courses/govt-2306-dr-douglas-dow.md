#### State and Local Government

#### Instructor: Dr. Douglas Dow

#### GOVT 2306

This honors seminar is designed as an introduction to the constitutional structure, institutional processes and political cultures of Texas, within the federal system of the United States. Our first goal will be to understand how American sub-national politics is contoured by its ever-evolving federal constitutional system. We will seek answers to a number of questions: What were the origins of the federal design in the American Constitution? How do the historical beginnings of government continue to shape contemporary politics? How have powers been divided and shared between the national government and the states? What are the functions of state government? How does the Texas Constitution resemble and differ from the U.S. Constitution? What has been the history of civil rights and liberties protection, and its impact on Texas state authority?
