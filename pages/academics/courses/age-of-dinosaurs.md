#### Age of Dinosaurs

#### Instructor: Homer Montgomery, Ph.D.

#### GEOS 2332

The Age of Dinosaurs is an introductory survey of the anatomy, physiology, lifestyles, populations, and evolution of dinosaurs and swimming and flying reptiles.  We also discuss Mesozoic climates and basic Earth history of the Age of Dinosaurs.  The course begins with an overview of the Mesozoic Era and of the science of taphonomy and ends with a close look at our work on dinosaurs in and near Big Bend National Park in west Texas.

The Age of Dinosaurs is not a typical lecture course.  Your professor will introduce topics and then participate in discussions that are influenced by student interests.  When the class would like a short lecture on a topic that will be arranged.  Discussions tend to be far ranging.  Group activities and presentations by students are common.  Bones and other manipulatives appear regularly in class.  Writing skills are a plus.

FIELD WORK OPPORTUNITY
If your interest is such, you may join us in Terlingua, TX where you will participate in ongoing fieldwork.  Details will be presented in class.
