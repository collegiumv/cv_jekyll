The purpose of the course is to supply the basic notions in the field of cellular neuroscience, and the intellectual tools for understanding recent advances in cellular neurobiology. Neurons are highly specialized cells, with distinctive architecture, organization, and electrical properties. In this course, we will explore the cell biology of the nervous system, with an emphasis on the fundamental signaling properties of neurons.   Students will identify and describe basic morphology and functions of neurons and glia, the cytology of subcellular organelles in neurons, electric neuronal models, the neuromuscular junction, central synapses, intracellular signaling mechanisms, and synaptic plasticity. Students will also identify important experimental techniques in cellular neuroscience and analyze relevant experimental data.
