#### Perspectives on Environmental Sustainability

#### Instructor: Dr. Jill Duquaine-Watson

#### HONS 3199

This course uses an interdisciplinary approach to explore varied perspectives on environmental sustainability and conservation. In addition to examining the historical roots of environmentalism and key arguments for conservation of natural resources and sustainability, we will also investigate contemporary debates about the environment (such as ecotourism and the protection of endangered species) in order to better understand how such debates are formed at the intersection of economic, political, legal, and social interests.
