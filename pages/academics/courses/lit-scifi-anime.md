Literature of Science Fiction: Anime/Manga: Apocalypse How?  Science Fiction is a genre of imaginative narrative that explores implications of developments in science and technology. This section focuses on how “apocalyptic” visions and fears appear in Japanese anime (animated films) and manga (graphic novels) along with speculative imaginings of ways human individuals and communities may be able to avoid or heal from “apocalyptic” uses of science and technology.  Class discussions will also include theories from literary and film theory, psychology, sociology and neuroscience about how visual and verbal “texts” express and make meaning within our human brains and across cultures.
