#### PHYS 2422

This course is designed to introduce the concepts in electricity, magnetism, and
electromagnetic waves, and eventually show how they are in fact simply
different facets of the same electromagnetic force, one of the four known
fundamental forces of nature. Here is a list of the basic topics that will be covered
in this course.

• Electric Charges, Forces and Fields
• Coulomb’s Law
• Gauss’s Law
• Electric Potential Energy
• Capacitance and Dielectrics
• Electric Current and Resistance
• Direct Current Circuits
• Magnetic Fields and Forces
• Lorentz Force Law for Charged Particles
• Electromagnetic Induction
• Faraday’s Law
• Lenz’s Law
• Maxwell’s Equations
• Electromagnetic Waves

At a slightly higher level, the course may go broader and deeper to introduce or understand several topics that are close to the research forefront. Here is a list of them: plasma, ferro-magnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, quantum Hall effects, magnetic monopoles in spin ice, toric code and quantum spin liquids, Hawking radiation, gamma ray burst, synthetic gauge fields, etc.

This is a calculus-based course on basic concepts in electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetic waves. The course is a deeper, broader, more interacting version of PHYS2326 in terms of its pace, scope, difficulty, and the calculus to be used. While the math is a natural and necessary ingredient, it is the physics that is at the heart of this course. We pursue the following objectives for students: (i) to learn specific laws of electromagnetism and their simple applications, (ii) to be comfortable with using vector calculus in physics problems, (iii) to develop and strengthen problem-solving skills, and (iv) “to guess at the wonderful, simple, but very strange patterns beneath them all, and then to experiment to check again whether we made the right guess” (R. Feynman). 
As a result of the course, students will be expected to be able to (i) explain basic concepts of charges, currents, fields, forces, and waves, (ii) apply basic laws to calculate electromagnetic fields and their effects, (iii) analyze simple electric circuits in direct-current and quasi-steady-state regimes, (iv) understand the Maxwell equations and their consequences, and, most importantly, (v) be confident with physics and math and appreciate their beauty!
