#### Energy, Water, and the Environment

#### Instructor: Dr. Stephanie Taylor

#### NATS 2333

An introduction to the impacts that humans have on the environment, with emphasis on impacts resulting from energy and water use. The course is designed for students who are not seeking a technical major and who wish to enhance their use of science and engineering principles and techniques in making decisions affecting both their own use of energy and water and use by the United States and the world. The course includes discussions of ways to ameliorate and/or adapt to the impacts. 

Energy, Water, and the Environment addresses the issues of human impact on the environment and how we, as stewards, can make sound technical decisions about strategies to ameliorate those effects. Topic will include --from the perspectives including energy supply, water resources, and the environment -- global climate change, energy and water basics and conservation, fossil fuels, nuclear energy, and alternative sources of energy (solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass). A major part of a student’s grade will be based on a project designed to educate individuals about “Energy, Water, and the Environment”.
