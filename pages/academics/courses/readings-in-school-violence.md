#### Readings in School Violence

#### Instructor:  Nadine Connell

#### HONS 3199

Issues related to school violence and victimization, especially with
regards to school shootings, are common discussion points in the
popular media, but understanding of the causes and consequences of
school violence is still limited.  This course will focus on
understanding school violence in the context of of post-9/11 world
with an emphasis on school shootings and security measures.  The
Columbine shooting will be used as a case study but we will discuss
the issue from the perspective of the three main stakeholders:
students, administrators, and parents.
