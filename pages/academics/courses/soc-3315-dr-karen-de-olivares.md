#### Socio-Behavioral Science for Medicine

#### Instructor: Dr. Karen de Olivares

#### SOC 3315

By instituting a new section of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) elevates the importance for the premedical student of understanding psychological and sociocultural determinants of health.  Other initiatives in the healthcare field, such as the Blue Zones ProjectTM, direct attention to behaviors deemed desirable for healthy living.  In this class we’ll consider constructs and theories people have used to explain individual human motivation and group behaviors, placing specific emphasis on patient compliance.
