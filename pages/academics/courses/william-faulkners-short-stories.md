#### William Faulkner’s Short Stories

#### Instructor: Dr. Theresa M. Towner

#### HONS 3199

Famed for his work as a novelist, the Mississippi-born William Faulkner was an equally accomplished writer of short fiction.  He once described the short story as “the most demanding form after poetry,” and this course will examine eleven of his forty-two collected stories to see the various ways in which he met those demands.  Note:  this course will treat different material than the previous two readings courses, and those courses are not prerequisites for this one.  No prior knowledge of Faulkner is required.
