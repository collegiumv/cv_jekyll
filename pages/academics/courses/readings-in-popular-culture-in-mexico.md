#### Readings in Popular Culture in Mexico

#### Instructor:  Monica Rankin

#### HONS 3199

This course will examine Mexican history through the lens of popular
culture in the post-independence era with particular attention to the
20th century.  We will examine issues that fall within that time
period thematically considering how recreational and other activities
that influenced (and continue to influence) the lives of Mexicans.
Possible themes include, but are not limited to, public festivals,
religion, sports, music, food, fashion, print media, television, and
film.  We will specifically focus on how various forms of popular
culture fit within a broader historical narrative, and in particular,
how popular culture contributes to a multi-faceted and continuously
evolving sense of national identity.
