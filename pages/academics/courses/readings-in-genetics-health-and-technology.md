The full sequence of the human genome was first published in 2001.
Since then, advances in sequencing and genetic technology has
contributed to our understanding of how our genes affect human health
and disease. Genetic testing and gene therapies are now clinical
realities. How do these technologies impact patients and families
dealing with genetic disorders? What are the medical, social, and
economic consequences of advanced genetics in the clinic? What are the
limitations? In this course, we will explore the role of current and
emerging genetic technology in science and medicine.
