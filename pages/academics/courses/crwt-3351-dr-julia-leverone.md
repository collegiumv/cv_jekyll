#### Instructor: Dr. Julia Leverone

#### CRWT 3351

In Creating Poetry, we will devote ourselves to thinking about and putting into practice the infinitesimal-infinite possibilities of poetic expression by reading, discussing, and writing poetry. Ultimately, we will strive to parse out meanings that are conveyed in techniques apart from content. The collections we will engage with will be acutely contemporary, and so will afford us a sense of the present US American poetry culture. This course has a workshop component.
