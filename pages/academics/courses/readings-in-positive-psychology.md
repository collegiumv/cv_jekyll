#### HONS 3199

An often attributed but unsubstantiated quote by Abraham Lincoln famously reads:“Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.”

In a field that has traditionally been focused on dysfunction and disorder, Lincoln’s (possible) intuitive musing underlines the most important tenet of positive psychology; the notion that we can “choose” to be happy. The positive psychology movement has captured our collective imaginations. Despite the popularity of this growing sub-field, substantive empirical investigations and contributions from other disciplines, others deride the positive psychology movement as simplistic, unscientific, and, according to some, delusional and full of possibly dangerous ideas and messages. This course introduces students to the emerging field of positive psychology through an examination of its history, contemporary tenets and socio-cultural contexts. Positive psychology focuses on optimal human functioning from a strengths perspective and applies empirical findings to examine topics such as optimism, happiness, flow, mindfulness and resilience.

After completing the course, students should be able to:
1) Describe and explain the nature of positive psychology as a scientific discipline
2) Describe and analyze major theoretical perspectives and overarching themes in positive psychology
3) Use critical thinking to evaluate popular media and scholarly literature
4) Demonstrate effective writing skills
5) Demonstrate how principles in positive psychology can explain and inform clinical issues, social issues, organizational issues, and public policy
