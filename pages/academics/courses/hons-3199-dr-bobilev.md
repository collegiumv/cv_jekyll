#### Readings in Consciousness: The Mind and The Brain

#### Instructor: Dr. Anastasia Bobilev

#### HONS 3199

In the 17th century, philosophers like Descartes questioned whether the mind and brain are distinct entitles, and how they interact.  Almost 400 years later, with neuroscience and biotechnology accelerating at an unprecedented pace, philosophers and scientists are still struggling with the same questions.  What is consciousness? Can we recreate it?  What are our ethical responsibilities if we do?  In this course, we will learn the different ways that philosophers, computer scientists and neuroscientists approach human consciousness and intelligence through books, classic cognitive science thought experiments, and recent findings in psychology and neuroscience.  We will discuss how the approaches of different academic fields of study can be applied concurrently to deepen our understanding of the mind and the brain.  We will read about current advances in artificial intelligence, brain-computer interfaces and biological systems that may have the potential to develop consciousness, and will therefore also discuss the ethical considerations surrounding the potential applications of these technologies.  In addition to the primary readings, we will explore primary news sources, scientific opinions and commentaries, and discuss films that provide different perspectives on consciousness and artificial intelligence.
