#### State and Local Government

#### Instructor: Dr. Douglas Dow

#### GOVT 2306

This honors seminar is designed as an introduction to the constitutional structure, institutional processes and political cultures of Texas, within the federal system of the United States. Our first goal will be to understand how American sub-national politics is contoured by its ever-evolving federal constitutional system. We will seek answers to a number of questions: What were the origins of the federal design in the American Constitution? How do the historical beginnings of government continue to shape contemporary politics? How have powers been divided and shared between the national government and the states? What are the functions of state government? How does the Texas Constitution resemble and differ from the U.S. Constitution? What has been the history of civil rights and liberties protection, and its impact on Texas state authority?
The second goal of the course will be to understand those processes and institutions through which citizens behave politically. What is political culture? How are state and local politics shaped by political pluralism? How do people come to articulate political beliefs? What kinds of groups do people create and join to promote their ideas and interests? How do these groups interact with governmental actors themselves? We shall explore the development and evolution of political parties, the growing dominance of interest groups, the importance of public opinion and the role of political culture in shaping the information Texans have about their government and society.
