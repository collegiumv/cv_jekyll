#### HONS 3199

The brain is a fundamentally plastic organ, able to store information and shape its responses based on experience.  Memory in its many forms is essential for our day-to-day existence, and so disruptions in memory have profound clinical implications. Aberrations in memory formation underlie neurological disorders including addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Diseases where memories are lost, such as Alzheimer’s, are devastating. How does memory work?  Where in the brain do memories live? What is the biological basis of memory storage, and how reliable is it? What happens when we can’t trust our memories, when we can’t make new memories, or when we lose the memories we once had? In this course we will explore the importance and fragility of memory through clinical cases, memories, and scientific literature.
