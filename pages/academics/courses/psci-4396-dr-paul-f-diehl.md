#### Approaches to Peace

#### Instructor: Dr. Paul F. Diehl

#### PSCI 4396

Are India and Pakistan or the US and North Korea at peace simply because they are not at war?  Is Dallas at peace because no one was shot today?  This Honors course looks beyond “peace as the absence of violence” to explore what peace is and how it might be achieved through various approaches (see the course syllabus posted in Coursebook).  There are several unique features of the course:
    • No prerequisites and suitable for freshmen to seniors and students from all majors.
    • Interdisciplinary orientation, with topics and issues from biology, religious studies, history, anthropology, engineering, political science, philosophy, psychology, and economics
    • Simulations and games: nuclear war, negotiations, “cake-cutting”
    • Movies, music, cartoons and more about peace
    • No final exam; all major requirements completed before final exam week.
