#### HUMA1301

Intended to introduce students to various fields of study within the humanities, this section of HUMA 1301 will examine the question of what constitutes an honorable life.  Students will keep a formal, ongoing reading journal of responses to course assignments and issues, which will be due twice during the semester; in addition, students will take one in-class examination and produce a final project constituting a meditation on or expression of their personal conception of honor.  Each of these four major elements will count as 25% of the studentâ€™s course grade.  I expect regular attendance and active participation from each student; the quality of those elements will settle any questions of borderline course grades.
