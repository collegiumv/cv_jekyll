#### State and Local Government

#### Instructor: Dr. Euel Elliott

#### GOVT 2306

This course is designed to provide students in the Honors program with an introduction to Texasâ€™s State government and politics. The course covers topics related to state government and the public policy process that are especially relevant of students preparing for a career in medicine. The course begins with a discussion of Texas political culture and the political economy of Texas within the framework of federalism, and the Texas Constitution. The course then proceeds to a discussion of political parties, elections, state government structures and public policy. Given the relatively small class size, the course will be conducted primarily through seminar-type discussions and periodic student presentations. There will also be guest presentations scheduled strategically during the semester. Also, it is crucial that the student will have read the material prior to class and be prepared to discuss.
