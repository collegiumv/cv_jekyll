#### Innocence Project

#### Instructor:  Natalie Roetzel

#### PSCI 4396.HN1

Students in this class will examine how innocent persons are convicted
of crimes.  We will study trial records of persons in prison who claim
they are innocent to see if their cases raise issues suggesting their
innocence.  If so, we will recommend to the Innocence Project of Texas
that their lawyers delve further into the cases to see if these
persons may be exonerated.  Cases that present the strongest
likelihood of wrongful conviction are cases where DNA testing would be
appropriate or cases where the conviction is based on "junk science."
