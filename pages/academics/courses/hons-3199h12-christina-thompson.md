#### Readings in Science Fiction

#### Instructor: Christina Thompson

#### HONS 3199.H12

Science fiction writing often asks the question what if? What if there were machines that looked like and could do the work of humans?  What if man could go to the moon?  These questions and others have inspired scientists for generations to push the boundaries of what is possible. In this Science in Science Fiction readings course we will read short science fiction stories from a science perspective. Students will learn to identify and discuss a broad range of scientific topics found in literature, from chemistry and biology to robotics and space flight. We will explore the accuracy of how scientific ideas are presented, and the impact that speculative science can have on technology development in the real world.
