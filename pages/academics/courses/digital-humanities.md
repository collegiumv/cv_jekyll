#### Themes and Ideas in American History: The Digital Humanities 

#### Instructor: Dr. Ben Wright

#### HIST 2330

Our world is increasingly digital. What does this mean for the study of history? How 
does digital technology change the way we research and present scholarship in American 
history? What is gained and what is lost by these changes? This course has three goals: 
Students will analyze theoretical issues in the emerging field of digital humanities; 
students will evaluate works of digital scholarship in American history; and students 
will create original scholarship in the field of American history through digital 
tools. Skills in computer science are helpful but not required for success in this 
course.
