#### Readings in Faulkner's Short Stories

#### Instructor:  Theresa Towner

#### HONS 3199

Famed for his work as a novelist, the Mississippi-born William
Faulkner was an equally accomplished writer of short fiction.  He once
described the short story as "the most demanding form after poetry,"
and this course will examine the various ways in which the forty-two
of his Collected Stories meet those demands.  I will not assume any
previous knowledge of or experience with reading Faulkner.
