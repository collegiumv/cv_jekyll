#### Reading in the Addicted Brain

#### Instructor: Eva LaDow

#### HONS3199.HN4

In order for their species to survive, animals must eat, drink and
reproduce. There is thus evolutionary pressure to maintain a neural
reward system that provides an incentive, pleasure, to do these
things.  Importantly, the reward system is trainable, allowing us to
learn to associate pleasure with specific activities. This
trainability can also be a liability, as non-essential or even
dangerous behaviors can trigger this reward circuit. What happens in
the brain when we experience pleasure? How does this drive behavior?
What happens when the brain’s reward system is hijacked by addiction?
How does the desire for certain pleasures shape our societies and
economies?  In this course, we will address these questions to gain a
broad understanding of how pleasure and reward shape the human
experience.
