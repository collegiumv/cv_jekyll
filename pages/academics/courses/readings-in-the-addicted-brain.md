In order for their species to survive, animals must eat, drink and reproduce. There is thus evolutionary pressure to maintain a neural reward system that provides an incentive, pleasure, to do these things.  Importantly, the reward system is trainable, allowing us to learn to associate pleasure with specific activities. This trainability can also be a liability, as non-essential or even dangerous behaviors can trigger this reward circuit. What happens in the brain when we experience pleasure? How does this drive behavior? What happens when the brainâ€™s reward system is hijacked by addiction? How does the desire for certain pleasures shape our societies and economies?  In this course, we will address these questions to gain a broad understanding of how pleasure and reward shape the human experience.
