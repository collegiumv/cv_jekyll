#### Introduction to Neuroscience

#### Instructor: Eva LaDow

#### NSC3361.HN1

This course serves as an introduction to the field of neuroscience. It
is a survey of neurobiology from the cellular building blocks of the
brain regions and processes that underlie vision, hearing, language,
sex, emotion, hunger, thirst, and more. We’ll also discuss
psychoactive drugs, mental illness, and how we learn and remember.
Students will describe the anatomy and organization of the nervous
system as it relates to a number of important physiological processes
and behaviors. Students will describe the basic cell b Students will
describe the basic cell biology and pharmacology of the nervous
system, with a focus on synaptic transmission. Students will apply
this knowledge to analyze how perturbing specific brain regions or
neurotransmission may alter behavior. Students will also describe
central principles of behavioral neuroscience such as homeostasis and
plasticity.
