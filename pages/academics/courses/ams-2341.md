#### American Studies for the 21st Century

#### Instructor: Dr. Erin Smith

#### AMS 2341

This course introduces students to reading, writing, and discussion about American
literary and historical texts from the colonial period to the present.  
Our thematic focus is on “crime.”  The course surveys some of the most exciting recent
work in 5 major areas:  race and ethnicity; gender and sexuality; religion;
transnationalism; social class, labor, and consumption.  We read historical studies of
popular crime literature from the 18th and 19th centuries, detective novels from the
1920s and 1930s and the noir films based on them, contemporary novels engaging with
celebrated criminal cases, and historical and contemporary analyses of the 
relationships between race, social class, and criminality.  Students will learn: (1) to 
situate contemporary debates on these issues in larger historical and theoretical 
contexts; (2) to evaluate arguments and evidence critically; and (3) to be close 
readers of historical, literary and visual texts.
