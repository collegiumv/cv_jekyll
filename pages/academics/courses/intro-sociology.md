#### Introduction to Sociology

#### Instructor: Sheryl Skaggs

#### SOC 1301.HN1

This course provides an overview of the discipline of
sociology, introducing students to major concepts, theories, scholars and
research. Students will learn how to view and understand the world around them
by considering connections between behavior, outcomes and social context. In
other words, students will learn how oneâ€™s social environment influences behavior,
opportunities and outcomes. Topics to be covered in the course include: 1) the
sociological imagination and the work of C. Wright Mills in examining social
phenomena; 2) key sociological theoretical perspectives; 3) methodological
approaches to examining sociological questions; 4) examination of major
concepts and principles of sociology. The course is designed not only to
develop knowledge about the field of sociology but also to apply the
information to issues related to health and health care, race/ethnicity,
education, culture, work, and families. The class format will be a combination
of lectures and seminar discussion. Student attendance and participation are
critical to the learning environment.
