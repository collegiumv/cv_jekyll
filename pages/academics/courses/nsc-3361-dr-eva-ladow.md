#### Neuropharmacology

#### Instructor: Dr. Eva LaDow

#### NSC 3361

This course provides an in-depth exploration of synaptic transmission, signal transduction, and structure/activity relationships of psychoactive drugs. We will begin with basic principles of pharmacology, including basic pharmacokinetics and dynamics to provide a broad framework for how we understand drug action and elimination by the body.  We will then consider 1) universal features of synaptic transmission and vesicular neurotransmitter release; 2) typical amine neurotransmitter systems, both ionotropic and metabotropic; and finally 3) peptide and atypical neurotransmitters such as endocannabinoids. We will cover pharmacology relevant to each system, including laboratory and clinical uses.  We will also discuss drugs of abuse and the neural basis for addiction. Neuropharmacology is a core course for the neuroscience major, but may be of strong interest for other biological science majors and pre-health students.
