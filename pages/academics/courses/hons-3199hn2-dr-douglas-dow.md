#### Readings in Foreign Film & Political Culture

#### Instructor: Dr. Douglas Dow

#### HONS 3199.HN2

Film is the newest of the art forms, and the most popular style of entertainment of the past century. Movies are one of the most powerful tools for shaping popular tastes and beliefs, including perceptions and expectations concerning the government, the workplace, religion, and the family. The influence of cinema on politics is high; so too is the impact of external political, social and economic forces on movies and the film industry. This class is designed as an introduction to domestic and world cinema, and an exploration of the complex dynamics between films and politics. 

Each week, we will explore a single film from a number of different contexts. We will animate the political and social concerns behind the film’s theme and chart the histories of government influence upon the fate of each film. We will explore how each film exemplifies a particular national film movement, or reflects the evolving identity of a specific movie genre. We will also learn how to “read” a film, in order to better comprehend how its messages are conveyed through style, editing, shot composition, and other techniques of film making.

How did things change so drastically and in such a short period of time?
