#### HIST2330.HN1

Themes and Ideas in American History: The Digital Humanities - Our
world is increasingly digital. What does this mean for the study of
history? How does digital technology change the way we research and
present scholarship in American history? What is gained and what is
lost by these changes? This course has three goals: Students will
analyze theoretical issues in the emerging field of digital
humanities; students will evaluate works of digital scholarship in
American history; and students will create original scholarship in the
field of American history through digital tools. Skills in computer
science are helpful but not required for success in this course.
