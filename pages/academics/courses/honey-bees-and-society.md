Without bees humans will die within 4 years â€“ Albert Einstein.  While this may or may not be true, there is a very complex relationship between Apis mellifera and society.  While most people associate honey bees with being stung and eating honey, bees are actually extremely integral to our current agricultural practices.  In this survey course, Honey Bees and Society, we will explore topics ranging from the biology of individual bees to how the colony as a superorganism makes decisions. We will utilize both general audience books and scientific review articles to give a complete picture of the importance of honey bees on our culture.
