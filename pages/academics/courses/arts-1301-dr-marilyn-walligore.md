#### Exploration of the Arts

#### Instructor: Dr. Marilyn Walligore

#### ARTS 1301

This interdisciplinary arts course will involve processes— participating in workshops, generating creative projects, contributing to critiques, discussing readings, writing responses, viewing art exhibitions and performances— to develop students’ awareness of the meaning and context that informs personal expression and guides interpretation of art.  Exercises are designed to encourage students’ reflection on their abilities in and knowledge of the arts, to foster experimentation, to expand students’ appreciation of a diverse range of art practices, and to heighten their sensorial perception of artworks.   Students will study historical and contemporary visual and performing art practices within a larger social and cultural framework by reviewing the activity and intellectual engagement of artists working across creative disciplines. Requirements include a creative project as well as written assessments of visual and performing arts.

Using photography and digital media as a point of departure, students will explore and analyze how space, time, image, text, and gesture are applied and communicate ideas through various art forms. Students should have access to a smart phone or digital camera, and storage media for digital files. Cost of materials may vary: estimate $50.
