#### Readings in Scientific Research Methods

#### Instructor: Dr. Eric Kildebeck

#### HONS 3199

Explores contemporary interdisciplinary topics on the practice of scientific research and the scientific method. We focus on practical strategies for developing scientific skills as an undergraduate student including grant writing and experimental design. Specifically, students learn useful details about scientific writing, designing experiments, and grant writing. Students also work in teams to create an original scientific proposal on any scientific topic of their choosing, write an abridged grant to support the proposal and pitch their idea to the rest of the class.
