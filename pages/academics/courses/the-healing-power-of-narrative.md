#### The Healing Power of Narrative

#### Instructor: Robert Schwab, MD

Everyone loves a good story, but mounting neuroscientific evidence suggests that the human brain is hardwired for narrative.  Furthermore, additional evidence suggests a therapeutic role for narrative, for both caregivers and patients. This one-hour reading and discussion course will explore how stories can help achieve healing, for those who suffer as well as those who would alleviate suffering.

The course will begin by exploring the classic narrative structure and the elements required to create a good story. The science behind narrative and the human brain will be discussed, and then the focus on narrative and health care will lead to discussions of empathy, sympathy, suffering, and healing.

Students will be expected to read a weekly short article and two books over the course of the semester, participate in class discussions, and write a brief reflective paper at the end of the course.
