#### Readings in Sensation and Experience

#### Instructor: William Marks

#### HONS 3199

Much of our daily decision making is based on our perceptions of the world around us. We assume that our experience is a seamless view of the world around us, but how does what we sense get used to help us interact with the world? Our brains are tasked with the task of transforming light, sound, and a myriad of other sensory inputs into meaningful data using a number of unconscious processes. What happens if that pathway if broken? What if the information is manipulated before it even gets processed? This course will explore the basics of sensory processing, how we can use sensory information to trick our brains, and what happens when our sensory experience breaks down. We will also explore some of the societal applications of perception such as empathy, group think, and subliminal messaging.
