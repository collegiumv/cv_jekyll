#### Health and Illness

#### Instructor: Dr. Richard Scotch

#### SOC 4372

Medicine is a social science, as much as it is a biological science.  Who gets sick, what they do about it, and what kind of treatment they receive are the result of an interplay of behavioral, cultural, and social forces. In this course we will examine how behavioral, social, and cultural factors affect health and illness. We will also address a number of  ethic issues in health care decision making. This class will involve lectures by the instructor, presentations on the readings by students, seminar discussion, and occasional guest lectures and media presentations.  

In this course, students will learn about 1) social and demographic factors associated with health and illness, including social class, race/ethnicity, gender, and education; 2) how social scientists have interpreted health and illness behavior; 3) the nature of American health professions and institutions, and how these professions and institutions are responding to recent economic, social, political, and technological trends; and 4) ethical values and dilemmas found within the American health care system.
