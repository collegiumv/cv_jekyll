#### Readings in the Secret Lives of Bees

#### Instructor:  Christina Thompson

#### HONS 3199

"Without bees humans will die within 4 years." â€“ Albert Einstein.
While this may or may not be true, there is a very complex
relationship between Apis mellifera and society.  While most people
associate honey bees with being stung and eating honey, bees are
actually extremely integral to our current agricultural practices.  In
this survey course, Honey Bees and Society, we will explore topics
ranging from the biology of individual bees to how the colony as a
superorganism makes decisions.  We will utilize both general audience
books and scientific review articles to give a complete picture of the
importance of honey bees on our culture.
