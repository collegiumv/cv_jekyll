#### Civil Liberties

#### Instructor:  Dr. Douglas Dow

#### PSCI 3303

Identifying, demanding and protecting individual rights have been essential parts of American political development, especially during the last half century.  Civil liberties and civil rights establish the structure and set limits to the relationship between individuals and government, as well as condition the relationship between citizens.  This course provides an introduction to the law and politics of constitutional interpretation, as it pertains to the rights of the individual.  Our course will begin with an examination of the First Amendment’s freedom of speech, religion and press.  We will look at the changes and expansions of this amendment over time, as well as explore such contemporary debates as hate speech and the role of religion in government.  Second, we will examine the development of the Fourteenth Amendment’s civil rights, especially the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause.  

Our course has a number of goals.  Our first goal is to develop an understanding of the doctrinal development of the Constitution, as the Supreme Court defines, advances, limits and sometimes avoids its own precedents.  Second, to fulfill this first goal, we will learn the technical skills to properly read and brief case law.  Third, we will locate particular cases within their historical and political context, which will include the social impact key cases have had.  Fourth students will learn how to critically evaluate the actions of the Supreme Court and the reasoning of the justices.
