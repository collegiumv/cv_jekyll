#### American Popular Culture

#### Instructor: Dr. Erin Smith

#### AMS 2300.HN1

This course examines American culture through some of its most popular cultural formsâ€”best-selling novels, magazines, advertising, television, Hollywood films, sports, and popular music. Although we will make connections between the present and the past, the course is focused specifically on the popular culture of the Cold War (mainly 1950s and 1960s) through Hollywood films, pulp novels, television sit-coms and early rock music. We will consider such topics as: norms about gender and sexuality; the post-War religious revival and its co-existence with increasingly secular ways of being in the world; the Cold War and efforts to contain communism abroad; race and early civil rights activity; class and consumption in burgeoning suburbs.
