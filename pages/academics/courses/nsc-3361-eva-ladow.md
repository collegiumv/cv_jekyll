#### Introduction to Neuroscience

#### Instructor: Eva LaDow

#### NSC 3361

This course serves as an introduction to the field of neuroscience. It is a survey of neurobiology from the cellular building blocks of the brain regions and processes that underlie vision, hearing, language, sex, emotion, hunger, thirst, and more. Weâ€™ll also discuss psychoactive drugs, mental illness, and how we learn and remember.  Students will describe the anatomy and organization of the nervous system as it relates to a number of important physiological processes and behaviors. Students will describe the basic cell b Students will describe the basic cell biology and pharmacology of the nervous system, with a focus on synaptic transmission. Students will apply this knowledge to analyze how perturbing specific brain regions or neurotransmission may alter behavior. Students will also describe central principles of behavioral neuroscience such as homeostasis and plasticity.
