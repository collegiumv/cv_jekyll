#### HONS 3115

This class explores opportunities to get involved in undergraduate research at UT Dallas and focuses on learning about active areas of research at UT Dallas. This course is designed to give students face time with some of our most respected faculty at UT Dallas and the chance to learn about the active areas of research in these outstanding faculty membersâ€™ laboratories. We have one guest faculty member join the class each week to discuss their work, how they got to this point in their career and what impact they hope their work will have on the future.
