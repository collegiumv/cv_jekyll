#### Exploration of the Humanities

#### Instructor: Dr. Michael Wilson

#### HUMA 1301

This General Education Core course (Honors section) serves as an introduction to the humanities in the western tradition. We will read, examine, and discuss works of philosophy, literature, and visual culture. Our readings will lead us to discuss some of the central questions of the humanistic tradition: What does it mean to be human? How are we to order our experience, our interactions with others, and our society? What is the relation between art and life? Our ultimate goal will be to achieve an understanding of the value of the humanities for both a liberal arts education and our culture.
