#### Themes & Ideas in American History

#### Instructor: Dr. Whitney Stewart

#### HIST 2330

As the great sage and cultural icon Madonna once noted: “we are living in a material world, and I am a material girl.” What’s that to do with a history class? The deeper meaning behind this seemingly straightforward statement parallels the fundamental tenets of a field of historical study known as material culture: the insistence that objects are prevalent and essential to past societies; the recognition that humans are an active part of their material worlds; and the understanding that culture expresses itself through material objects.

Material culture involves the investigation of artifacts to understand the beliefs of a community or society at a particular moment. In this course, we will examine how things—artworks, objects, landscapes, buildings—serve as primary evidence about American society and culture, past and present. Through readings, discussion, and direct observation (including site visits to local cultural organizations like the Dallas Museum of Art), we will explore themes in American history through the material remnants left behind.
