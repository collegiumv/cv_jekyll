#### Readings in Our Senses, Our Selves

#### Instructor: Dr. LaDow

#### HONS 3199

Everything we see, hear, smell, touch, taste, and think arises from a mix of interactions with the physical environment and how our nervous system processes those interactions. In other words, the lens of the mind is integral to our understanding of the world and ourselves. How much of what perceive is “real”? How would you verify your perceptions’ reality? What does it mean when we see, hear, and feel things that others don’t? What happens when more than one person shares the same delusion? In this course, we will explore the neuroscience and psychology behind the discordance between what the mind experiences and the outer physical world. Illusions, hallucinations, mental illness, mass hysteria, and more will be discussed.
