#### MATH 2419.HN1

Improper integrals, sequences, infinite series, power series, vectors, matrices, functions of several variables, level sets, curves in Rn, partial derivatives and applications, implicit function theorem, multiple integration, change of variables, vector fields.

1. Students will be able to articulate the concept of improper integral sequence series, convergence; limit, continuity, differentiation, and integration of multivariable function.
2. Students will be able to apply tests for convergence, find radius and interval of convergence.
3. Students will be able to use the chain rule, Taylorâ€™s Theorem, find extrema and constrained extrema of real valued function.
4. Students will be able to compute double and triple integrals, apply change of variables theorem in multiple integrals.
