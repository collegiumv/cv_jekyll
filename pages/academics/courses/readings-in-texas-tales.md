#### Readings in Texas Tales

#### Instructor: Ms Valerie Brunell

#### HONS 3199

Texas has a reputation that is often larger than life, but the state has always been a collection of individuals. In this readings course, we read some of the best of their stories. We read about Texans from the early days of statehood to stories that just happened. We read tales of independence, of border conflict and of cultural heritage. The course explores the landscape, history, and culture of Texas through books that focus on character and story.
