#### Untold Histories of Chemistry and Physics

#### Instructor: Mihaela Stefan

#### HONS 3199.H15

Spectacular discoveries at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 20th century advanced the knowledge in the fields of chemistry and physics. Relativity, atomic theory, quantum mechanics, radioactivity, periodicity of elements, X-ray crystallography, theories of bonding in organic compounds, elucidation of structure of DNA are some of the most revolutionary discoveries that were made during this time. The history of physics and chemistry is documented in many books and many biographies of physicists and chemists have been published. Scientists work together in teams or alone to make discoveries that are expected to advance the level of knowledge in their field of research. The Nobel prizes reward "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind". Many deserving scientists were recognized with Nobel prizes for their work but other have been overlooked. In this course we will discuss why some scientists have not received a Nobel prize for discoveries that deserved recognition. Another topic we will discuss in this course is the ethical problem that some discoveries brought in. For example, the two world wars forced scientists to consider ethical questions about the application of their research on the society. The selected book for this course is “Cathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry” by Patrick Coffey. This book reviews a seventy-year time span from 1883 to 1953, in which profound discoveries changed the faces of physics and chemistry. Principal actors scientists in the book are Svante Arrhenius, Walther Nernst, Gilbert Newton Lewis, Irving Langmuir, Fritz Haber, and Linus Pauling. Supporting roles in the book are Jacobus van’t Hoff, Whilhelm Ostwald, Paul Ehrlich, Theodore Richards, William Harkins, Harold Urey, Glenn Seaborg, and Dorothy Wrinch.
