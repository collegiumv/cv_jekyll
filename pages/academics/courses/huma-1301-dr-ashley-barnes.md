#### Exploration of the Humanities

#### Instructor: Dr. Ashley Barnes

#### HUMA 1301

This class introduces you to the methods and questions that connect the various fields of study in the humanities. Our thematic focus will be on love: stories about its varieties, accounts of its pleasures and sorrows, portrayals of how it pulls people together and drives them apart. In our investigation, we’ll crisscross from literature to film to philosophy to history to music and elsewhere. By the end of the semester, you should be able to explain the value of the humanities both for your own education and for the culture at large.
