This class introduces and provides models for application of the concepts of vector algebra.  Topics include finite dimensional vector spaces and their geometric significant; representing and solving systems of linear equations using multiple methods including Gaussian elimination and matrix inversion; matrices; determinants; linear transformations; quadratic forms; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; and applications in science and engineering.  Three lecture hours and two discussion hours a week; problems section required.
